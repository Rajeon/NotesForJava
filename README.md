CORS 
CROSS ORIGIN RESOURCE SHARING
 Cross-origin resource sharing is a mechanism that allows JavaScript on a web page to make AJAX requests to another domain, different from the domain from where it originated.
 CORS capability works by adding some specific HTTP headers that tell the browser that downloaded webpage should be allowed to make web requests to given/all domains. Also, you can add information to instruct browser to allow only certain HTTP methods (GET/PUT/POST/DELETE etc) on those domain URLs.
 
 Application Program Interface=(API)
 Java application programming interface (API) is a list of all classes that are part of the Java development kit (JDK). It includes all Java packages, classes, and interfaces, along with their methods, fields, and constructors. These prewritten classes provide a tremendous amount of functionality to a programmer.

POSTMAN:
 Postman is a powerful HTTP client for testing web services. Created by Abhinav Asthana, a programmer and designer based in Bangalore, India, Postman makes it easy to test, develop and document APIs by allowing users to quickly put together both simple and complex HTTP requests
 POSTMAN COMMANDS:
 POST - HTTP POST requests supply additional data from the client (browser) to the server in the message body.
 GET - GET requests include all required data in the URL.
 PUT - The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI.
 DELETE - The DELETE method requests that the origin server delete the resource identified by the Request-URI. 
 
 Mockito:
 Mockito is a mocking framework, JAVA-based library that is used for effective unit testing of JAVA applications. Mockito is used to mock interfaces so that a dummy functionality can be added to a mock interface that can be used in unit testing. Mockito facilitates creating mock objects seamlessly. It uses Java Reflection in order to create mock objects for a given interface. Mock objects are nothing but proxy for actual implementations.
 
 Karma & Jasmine:
 A tool called Karma is a JavaScript test runner created by the AngularJS team. Jasmine is the testing framework that we talked about in the getting started with unit testing for AngularJS post, and Karma provides helpful tools that make it easier to us to call our Jasmine tests whilst we are writing code.
 
 Difference between CommandLineRunner & CommandLine
    CommandLineRunner is an interface used to indicate that a bean should run when it is contained within a SpringApplication
    CommandLine is a program that takes commands in and operate through your computer system to run.
    @bean annotation is used to represent any class or method as logical unit of reusable code in an application
    
    Enums in Java:
    Enumerations serve the purpose of representing a group of named constants in a programming language.


Microservices:
Microservices are a form of service-oriented architecture style (one of the most important skills for Java developers) wherein applications are built as a collection of different smaller services rather than one whole app.

Microservices are a software development techniqueâ€”a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight.

Microservices, when used effectively, pay off
Used effectively, microservice architectures allow you to scale your application as the number of developers working on your application increases. ... That means keep tracking each time a new service is added to your system or a new connection between microservices is made

Why spring boot is used for Microservices?
Spring Boot enables building production-ready applications quickly and provides non-functional features: Embedded servers which are easy to deploy with the containers. It helps in monitoring the multiples components. It helps in configuring the components externally.
