CORS 
CROSS ORIGIN RESOURCE SHARING
 Cross-origin resource sharing is a mechanism that allows JavaScript on a web page to make AJAX requests to another domain, different from the domain from where it originated.
 CORS capability works by adding some specific HTTP headers that tell the browser that downloaded webpage should be allowed to make web requests to given/all domains. Also, you can add information to instruct browser to allow only certain HTTP methods (GET/PUT/POST/DELETE etc) on those domain URLs.
 
 Application Program Interface=(API)
 Java application programming interface (API) is a list of all classes that are part of the Java development kit (JDK). It includes all Java packages, classes, and interfaces, along with their methods, fields, and constructors. These prewritten classes provide a tremendous amount of functionality to a programmer.

POSTMAN:
 Postman is a powerful HTTP client for testing web services. Created by Abhinav Asthana, a programmer and designer based in Bangalore, India, Postman makes it easy to test, develop and document APIs by allowing users to quickly put together both simple and complex HTTP requests

 Mockito:
 Mockito is a mocking framework, JAVA-based library that is used for effective unit testing of JAVA applications. Mockito is used to mock interfaces so that a dummy functionality can be added to a mock interface that can be used in unit testing. Mockito facilitates creating mock objects seamlessly. It uses Java Reflection in order to create mock objects for a given interface. Mock objects are nothing but proxy for actual implementations.
 
 Karma & Jasmine:
 A tool called Karma is a JavaScript test runner created by the AngularJS team. Jasmine is the testing framework that we talked about in the getting started with unit testing for AngularJS post, and Karma provides helpful tools that make it easier to us to call our Jasmine tests whilst we are writing code.
